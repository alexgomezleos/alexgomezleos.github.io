                <p>
                    I am a Masters student in the <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/research/groups/wireless-networking-and-communications-group-wncg">Wireless Networking and Communications Group</a> at UT Austin, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/home">Sanjay Shakkottai</a>.
                    While at UT, my studies have been generously supported by the Virginia & Ernest Cockrell, Jr. Fellowship in Engineering.
                    Before that, I earned a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Texas A&M University, working with <a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/heidarzadeh-anoosheh/">Anoosheh Heidarzadeh</a>.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    I enjoy studying complexity bounds for algorithmic problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lately, I've been interested in lower bounds for low memory / low communication models.
                    I think its fascinating when a problem transitions from "efficiently solvable" to "completely intractable" upon relatively modest resource constraints.
                    A great example is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05161">this</a> well-known result from Ran Raz.
                    I feel these types of results give valuable insight to the following meta-question:
                    <em>
                        A common research thrust is to adapt known algorithms to increasingly stringent requirements, such as privacy or the ability to parallelize.
                        Can we really tweak the "textbook algorithm" to fit all our needs, or is it already pareto-optimal for basic resources?
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also interested in sublinear algorithms, mechanism design, and fair division.
                    <!-- I also like sublinear algorithms (<em>when can we test a property faster than we can learn it?</em>) and mechanism design (<em>how to deal with strategic agents?</em>). -->
                    Topics I've spent more time thinking about includes bandits, MDPs, distribution testing, and low-rank tensor estimation.

                <br> with Oscar Lopez
                <br> In review.
                <br>
                <br> <b>Summary:</b> We find a simple two-way reduction of rank-1 tensor completion to solving a pair of random linear systems.
                    The latter problem lets us bound the number of observations required to solve the original problem.

                <br> with Anoosheh Heidarzadeh
                <br> Presented at Information Theory Workshop (ITW), 2022. (<a href="https://alexgomezleos.github.io/slides/ITW2022-slides.pdf" target="_blank">slides</a>)
                <br>
                <br> <b>Summary:</b> Suppose you want to obtain some item from a database without revealing its identity.
                    A usual protocol borrows ideas from linear coding.
                    Before this work, the information-theoretic privacy guarantees break down when items that are not equally likely to be queried.
                    We developed a randomized protocol to solve this problem.
                    A key technical ingredient was proving an extremal property holding for sufficiently rich codes.
