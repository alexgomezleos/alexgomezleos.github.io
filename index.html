                    I am a Masters student in the <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/research/groups/wireless-networking-and-communications-group-wncg">Wireless Networking and Communications Group</a> at UT Austin, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/home">Sanjay Shakkottai</a>.
                    While at UT, my studies have been generously supported by the Virginia & Ernest Cockrell, Jr. Fellowship in Engineering.
                    Before that, I earned a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Texas A&M University, working with <a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/heidarzadeh-anoosheh/">Anoosheh Heidarzadeh</a>.

                    I enjoy studying complexity bounds for algorithmic problems.
                    Lately, I've been interested in lower bounds for fundamental problems under memory or communication constraints.
                    One of my favorite examples is the time-space tradeoff for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05161">parity learning</a>.
                    I think its facsinating that often the "textbook" algorithm for a task fails once stripped of resources we usually take for granted, like memory.

                    Other than lower bounds for resource constrained problems, my interest is also caught in sublinear algorithms (i.e. when can we test a property faster than we can learn it?), as well as mechanism design (i.e. how to deal with strategic agents?)
                    Topics that I've spent time more time thinking about includes algorithms for multi-armed bandits, MDPs, distribution testing, and more recently, low-rank tensor estimation.
                    <!-- I enjoy applications of probability, combinatorics, and optimization---often in the context of randomized algorithms.
                    My most immediate interest is in understanding the statistical and computational hardness of fundamental problems in modern data science.
                    I am also broadly interested in theoretical explanations for empirical phenomena in experimental ML. -->

                <p>
                    <!-- For these reasons, I gravitate towards: multi-armed bandits/RL, self-supervised learning, distributional testing, robust statistics, approximation algorithms.
                    Please get in touch if we share interests! -->

            I am a second generation Mexican-American.  My family comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Ju%C3%A1rez">Ciudad Ju√°rez</a>.
            One of my favorite ways to learn about other cultures is through their traditional cuisine and music.
            As a music geek, I used to have a radio show at <a href="https://kanm.tamu.edu/">KANM</a>.
            I play some instruments, recording quite a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGuoOcyLS4U">bit</a> as an undergraduate.
