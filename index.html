                <p>
                    I am a Masters student in the <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/research/groups/wireless-networking-and-communications-group-wncg">Wireless Networking and Communications Group</a> at UT Austin, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/home">Sanjay Shakkottai</a>.
                    While at UT, my studies have been generously supported by the Virginia & Ernest Cockrell, Jr. Fellowship in Engineering.
                    Before that, I earned a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Texas A&M University, working with <a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/heidarzadeh-anoosheh/">Anoosheh Heidarzadeh</a>.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    I enjoy studying complexity bounds for algorithmic problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lately, I've been interested in lower bounds for low memory / communication models.
                    I think its fascinating when a problem transitions from "efficiently solvable" to "completely intractable" upon relatively modest resource constraints.
                    A great example is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05161">this</a>.
                    I feel these types of results give valuable insight to the following meta-question:
                    <em>
                        A common research thrust is to adapt known algorithms to increasingly stringent requirements, such as privacy or the ability to parallelize.
                        Can we really tweak the "textbook algorithm" to fit all our needs, or is it already pareto-optimal for basic resources?
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also interested in sublinear algorithms, mechanism design, and fair division.
                    <!-- I also like sublinear algorithms (<em>when can we test a property faster than we can learn it?</em>) and mechanism design (<em>how to deal with strategic agents?</em>). -->
                    Topics I've spent more time thinking about includes bandit algorithms, MDPs, distribution testing, and low-rank tensor estimation.

                    Completion via Gauss-Jordan</a>
                <br> with Oscar Lopez
                <br> In review.
                <br> Summary: <em>We describe a simple two-way reduction of rank-1 tensor completion to solving a pair of random linear systems.
                    This latter problem lets us bound the number of observations required to solve the original problem.</em>

                <br> with Anoosheh Heidarzadeh
                <br> Presented at Information Theory Workshop (ITW), 2022. (slides)
                <br> Summary: <em>Suppose you want to obtain some item from a database without revealing any information about the identity of the item.
                    Before this work, there were protocols that use ideas from linear coding.
                    However, they relied on the assumption that each item is equally likely to be queried.
                    By randomizing previously known protocols, we relaxed this latter assumption.
                    The key technical ingredient was proving an extremal property holding for sufficiently large databases.</em>
