            <p>
                I am a M.Sc. student in the <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/research/groups/wireless-networking-and-communications-group-wncg">Wireless Networking and Communications Group</a> at UT Austin, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/home">Sanjay Shakkottai</a>.
                While at UT, my studies have been generously supported by the Virginia & Ernest Cockrell, Jr. Fellowship in Engineering.
                Before that, I earned a B.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Texas A&M University, working with <a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/heidarzadeh-anoosheh/">Anoosheh Heidarzadeh</a>.

            <p>
                I enjoy studying complexity bounds for algorithmic problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lately, I've been interested in lower bounds for low memory / low communication models.
                I think its fascinating when a problem transitions from "efficiently solvable" to "completely intractable" upon relatively modest resource constraints.
                A great example is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05161">this paper</a> by Raz.
                I feel it is natural to wonder the following:
                <em>
                    a common research thrust is to adapt known algorithms to increasingly stringent requirements, such as privacy or the ability to parallelize.
                    Can we really "tweak the textbook algorithm" to fit all our needs, or is it already pareto-optimal for basic resources?
                </em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also generally interested in sublinear algorithms, mechanism design, and fair division.
                <!-- I also like sublinear algorithms (<em>when can we test a property faster than we can learn it?</em>) and mechanism design (<em>how to deal with strategic agents?</em>). -->
                Topics I've spent more time thinking about includes bandits, MDPs, and distribution testing.

                Completion via Gauss-Jordan</a>
            <br> with Oscar Lopez
            <br> In review.
            <br> <b>Summary:</b> We showed a reduction of rank-1 tensor completion to solving a particular pair of random linear systems.
                This view allowed us to bound the number of required samples for the original problem.
                The sample complexity of the latter is given by a matrix sketching problem over GF2, which can't be analyzed using leverage score sampling.
                To circumvent this, we study the mixing time of a random walk on a special network of Grassmann graphs.

            <br> <b>Summary:</b> Suppose you want to obtain some item from a database without revealing its identity.
                A common two-party protocol based on linear codes can ensure strong privacy guarantees.
                In the prior work, these guarantees break down if the items are not equally likely to be queried.
                We developed a randomized protocol to solve this problem.
                A key technical ingredient was proving an extremal property holding for sufficiently rich codes.
